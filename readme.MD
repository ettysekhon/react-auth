Client confidentiality

Clients are designated either confidential or non-confidential.

Confidential clients keep their client secret hidden. For example, a server-side app that never exposes its secret to users.
Non-confidential clients cannot keep their client secret hidden. For example, client-side apps that store their client secret on the userâ€™s device, where it could be intercepted.

Non-confidential clients are not issued refresh tokens.
